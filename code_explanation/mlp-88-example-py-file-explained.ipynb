It's part of the standard library and helps you manipulate and parse URLs easily. URLs are the web addresses you use to access resources on the internet, like websites, images, documents, and more.\n\nIn simpler terms, imagine a URL (web address) like this: https://www.example.com/path/page?query=value#section\n\nThe urllib.parse module allows you to break down this URL into its different parts, like the protocol (https), the domain or hostname (www.example.com), the path (/path/page), the query string (query=value), and the fragment (section).\n\nYou can also use it to create URLs by combining these components. For example, you can create a new URL by providing the protocol, domain, path, query parameters, and more, and the module will assemble them into a valid URL.\n\nSo, in simple terms, urllib.parse helps you work with web addresses, whether you want to break them down into parts or create new ones. It's useful whenever you need to handle URLs in your Python code, especially when dealing with web-related tasks like fetching data from the internet or building URLs for APIs.\n\nURL parsing in simple terms refers to the process of breaking down a web address (URL) into its individual parts to understand and work with them separately. Just like you might break down a street address into components like house number, street name, city, and zip code, URL parsing involves breaking down a web address into parts like protocol, domain name, path, query parameters, and more.\n\nFor example, consider the URL: https://www.example.com:8080/path/page?name=John&age=25\n\nURL parsing involves:\n\nProtocol: In this case, https.\n\nDomain Name: The website's address, which is www.example.com.\n\nPort: Sometimes included, like :8080 in this case.\n\nPath: The location of the specific page or resource on the website, like /path/page.\n\nQuery Parameters: Additional information passed to the website, like name=John and age=25. These are often used for customization or data retrieval.\n\nFragment: A specific section within the page, indicated by #section.\n\nURL parsing is essential when you need to work with different parts of a web address separately. It helps you understand where you're going on the internet, what information you're sending or receiving, and how to interact with websites and web services.\n\n- mlflow.models.signature \nIn the context of MLflow, a model signature is like a \"label\" that describes the input and output types of a machine learning model. It helps others understand how to use the model correctly. Think of it as a way to show what kind of data the model expects as input and what kind of data it will produce as output.\n\nIn simpler terms:\n\nImagine a function in math: y = f(x). The signature would describe what types of x you can give to the function and what type of y you will get in return.\n\nSimilarly, a model signature tells you what kind of data you should provide as input when using the model, and what kind of data the model will give you as output.\n\nThis information is helpful for ensuring that you're using the model correctly and for integrating the model into other systems or tools. It's like a set of instructions that says, \"This is how you should talk to and understand this machine learning model.\n\n- mlflow.sklearn\nmlflow.sklearn is a part of the MLflow library that focuses on helping you manage, track, and work with machine learning models built using scikit-learn, which is a popular machine learning library in Python.\n\nIn simpler terms:\n\nImagine you've trained a machine learning model using scikit-learn, and you want an easy way to keep track of your experiments, log the models you've trained, and even deploy them.\n\nmlflow.sklearn provides tools that let you do just that. It helps you save your scikit-learn models, log their details, track different versions, and even share or deploy them.\n\nIt's like a bridge between your scikit-learn models and the MLflow platform, which helps you organize and manage your machine learning projects and experiments.\n\nSo, if you're using scikit-learn for machine learning, mlflow.sklearn gives you additional capabilities to help you keep everything organized and accessible.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import logging","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The statement import logging imports the built-in logging module in Python. The logging module provides a flexible framework for emitting log messages from your Python programs. Logging is an important practice in software development to capture information about the execution of a program, which can be useful for debugging, monitoring, and auditing.\n\nHere's a brief overview of how the logging module works:\n\n* Logger: The central concept in the logging module is the logger. You create a logger object that is used to emit log messages. You can create multiple logger instances to categorize and manage different types of log messages.\n* Log Levels: The module provides several log levels to indicate the severity of a log message, such as DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL. You can assign a log level to each logger to control which messages are emitted based on their severity.\n* Handlers: Loggers are configured with handlers, which specify where log messages should be sent. Handlers can direct messages to different destinations, such as the console, files, email, or external services.\n* Formatters: Formatters are used to control the format of log messages, including timestamp, log level, and the actual message content.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"logging.basicConfig(level=logging.WARN)\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The code sets up a basic configuration for the logging module in Python and creates a logger instance.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what each line of code does:\n\n1. logging.basicConfig(level=logging.WARN): This line configures the root logger with a basic logging configuration. It sets the minimum log level to WARNING (or WARN), which means that log messages with a severity level of WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL will be displayed, while messages with INFO and DEBUG severity will not be displayed. This configuration affects all loggers unless they are explicitly configured differently.\n2. logger = logging.getLogger(__name__): This line creates a logger instance named logger specific to the current module or script. The __name__ attribute is a special attribute in Python that holds the name of the current module. By using this, you can create a logger for each module or script, and it helps in distinguishing the source of log messages.\n\nPutting these two lines of code together, you're configuring the root logger to display warning-level and higher log messages (i.e., warnings, errors, and critical messages), and you're creating a module-specific logger instance that you can use to emit log messages from within that module. You can later use the logger instance to emit log messages with various severity levels and customize the logging behavior for that specific module.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def eval_metrics(actual, pred):\n    rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(actual, pred))\n    mae = mean_absolute_error(actual, pred)\n    r2 = r2_score(actual, pred)\n    return rmse, mae, r2","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The code defines a Python function named eval_metrics that calculates and returns three evaluation metrics commonly used in regression analysis.

RMSE is a measure of the average magnitude of the errors between predicted and actual values.\n2. mae = mean_absolute_error(actual, pred): Calculates the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between the actual and predicted values using the mean_absolute_error function from scikit-learn.

If it is, the subsequent code block will be executed. If the script is being imported as a module into another script, this block will be skipped.\n2. warnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\"): This line sets up a warning filter that suppresses warning messages. It instructs the Python interpreter to ignore any warning messages that might occur during the execution of the script. This can be useful to prevent warning messages from cluttering the output, especially when you're confident that the warnings are not critical.\n3. np.random.seed(40): This line sets the seed for the NumPy random number generator to 40. Setting the random seed ensures that the sequence of random numbers generated by NumPy will be the same each time you run the script. This is useful for reproducibility, especially in scenarios where you want to ensure consistent results during development and testing.\n\nTo summarize, when the script is run directly (not imported as a module), it suppresses warning messages using the warnings.filterwarnings function and sets the seed for the NumPy random number generator to ensure reproducibility of random number generation.

This enables you to store and manage your MLflow experiments on your own AWS infrastructure, which can be useful for maintaining control over data and resources and for ensuring secure and private experiment tracking.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"        tracking_url_type_store = urlparse(mlflow.get_tracking_uri()).scheme","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The code snippet retrieves the scheme (protocol) of the tracking URL used by MLflow for experiment tracking.
